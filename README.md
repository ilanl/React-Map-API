Google group map

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a webapp to manage
and display a shared pool of locations on a map.
Feel free to use any library or framework, as you see fit.

Requirements
The webapp should have a single page: A map component and the list of
locations next to it.
No login is required, the webapp should open directly on the main page.
The list of locations is shared, that means:
Everyone who opens the webapp should see the same locations.
